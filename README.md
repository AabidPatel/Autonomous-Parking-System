# Autonomous Parking System

Autonomous Parking System is an integrated system of a self-driving robot and smart parking garage to save fuel and time for parking. Eelf driving robot is based on a
Parallax Basic Stamp 2 microcontroller and a smart parking garage is based on an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller.

## **Smart Parking Garage**

The smart parking arena is equipped with Arduino Uno R3 which computes the empty parking spots by reading data from ultrasonic ping sensors attached at the parking spots. The goal is to determine the closest open parking spot from the total of empty parking spots in the arena. Once, the closest location to the car is computed then the data is sent to the smart car.
